Please run the bash script 
	downloadReposAndDatasets.sh 
to download both repos which we have worked on. 
 - The Tigr repo is made to compile for GTX 10 series GPUs, so if it fails, please change the sm flags to the corresponding GPU architecture 
 - The script will download the three datasets that we have used in our report and presentation and can be found under Tigr/datasets
 - After the script has finished, please make a UDT-transformed graph from a dataset by running a command like the one below while in the Tigr repo:

	./make_udt --is_weighted --input datasets/Higgs/higgs-social_network.edgelist_weighted

 - This will give an output called udt_graph.txt in the root directory of Tigr which is our transformed intermediate representation of a graph
 - To change the part_size parameter which details how large a node should be before it should split, please change it in Tigr/shared/globals.hpp and make clean and make -f Test_Makefile to recreate make_udt


Next, we take this udt_graph.txt and input it into CuSha, which we have changed a bit for working with weights for virtual nodes.
 - Currently, CuSha is setup to run the BFS algorithm on the input graph. If you would like to change it to SSSP, please comment out BFS and uncomment SSSP in CuSha/common/user_specified_global_configurations.h
 - To run CuSha, run a command similar to the one below:

	./cusha --input ../Tigr/udt_graph.txt --method GS --output out.txt


In order to get baselines from Tigr for a specific graph, please run the following while in the Tigr directory:
	./bfs --input datasets/Higgs/higgs-social_network.edgelist_weighted
		or
	./sssp --input datasets/Higgs/higgs-social_network.edgelist_weighted
For reference, we looked at the time required for processing only for Tigr
